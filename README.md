# Turtle Gambling Game
This is a python game made solely using the **turtle** module for graphical display, the **time** module for the core game loop,
and the **random** module for randomized movement of the turtles. 

## Features
It has:
- a basic gambling system where bets can be placed on any turtles, allowing for arbitrage betting as well.
- an end goal (making a certain amount of money).
- a semi-randomized system for the movement of the turtles (it is slightly rigged for a more entertaining experience compared to a more linear system),
